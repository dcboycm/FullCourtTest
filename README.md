# Introduction
FullCourtTest is an API testing project skeleton for interviewing potential candidates. It uses Mocha, Chai, and Axios to send requests and verify responses, ensuring the API returns accurate and reliable data.

# Features
- 🚀 Automated API tests with Mocha & Chai
- 🔍 Validates understanding of testing API's
- 📊 Generates JUnit test reports for analysis
- 🔐 Supports environment variables with dotenv

# Objective
Your task is to implement API test cases for the [Petstore API](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/) using Node.js with Mocha, Chai, and Axios. You will also be required to debug and fix a broken test.

# Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository

2.	Install dependencies:

    `npm install`

3.	Use the provided .env file to configure the API base URL.

4.	Run tests:

    `npm test`


# Tasks
1. CRUD operations for Pets endpoint
- Create a pet (POST /pet)
- Get pet details (GET /pet/{petId})
- Update a pet (PUT /pet)
- Delete a pet (DELETE /pet/{petId})

2. Validate Response Structure and Status Codes
- Correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- Expected response body (Check attributes like id, name, status).
- Proper handling of invalid requests (e.g., querying a non-existent pet).

3. Debug and Fix a Broken Test
- You will find a pre-written test in the test/e2e/tests/brokenTests.js file.
- Your task: Fix the test so that it runs successfully.
- The test might have incorrect assertions, missing data, or API request issues.
- Debug and resolve any issues while ensuring correctness.
